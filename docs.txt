>> Known Bugs:
Nested Loops OR If statements breaking (Try to avoid for now)


>> Abbreviations

Types:
<int> -> Can be any variable OR value that is a intiger
<char> -> Can be any varaible OR value that is a char

Variables:
<VarType> -> A Variable Type e.g. "int" or "char"
<Var> -> A Variable of a given type

Signs <Sign>:
 ==
 >=
 <=
 >
 <

Operators <operator>:
 +

 *
 / (Always rounds to closest whole number)
 %

Other:
... -> Some Code


>> Declaration Of A Variable

<VarType> <VarName> = <Value>

E.g.
int TheAnswer = 42


>> Performing Mathmatical Opperations

<int> = <int> <operator> <int>

E.g.
Total = subTotal1 + subTotal2


>> Looping (for)

LOOP <int>
	...
NEXT

> The <int> is the number of times to loop

E.g.
LOOP 5
	OUTPUT TheAnswer
NEXT

>> If statements:

IF <Var> <Sign> <Var>
	...
ENDIF
